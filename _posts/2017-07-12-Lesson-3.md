    <td>This lesson I worked on some small details in my blog, a change that I made is that when you hover over links they are now pink instead of the standard blue. I thought it would be a nice touch and would make my website a little bit different to others. 
This lesson I also added a new background, I felt a change would be nice and I came across a really nice one.</td>
