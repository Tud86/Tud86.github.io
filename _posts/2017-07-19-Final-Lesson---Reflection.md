    <td>So, this blog is very much a reflection, looking back at what I have done through year 9 in computing. This term I have been working on developing my blog page, I have finally worked out how to put in images that you can see on the page, I have changed the colours of the links when you hover over them, they are now white normally, but pink when you hover over them. I have made lots of other simple changes to customise the page and make it my own like wallpaper, avatar and other things. In general, I have enjoyed working on my Github blog and I might continue blogging even after the course has finished.</td>
