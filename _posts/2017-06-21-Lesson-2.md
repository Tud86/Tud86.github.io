    <td>At the start of today's lesson we attempted a starter activity on python. We needed to create a piece of python that would ask your name, give the length of the name, and talk about the name. Initially I couldn't make mine work, but after a bit of help from people near me, I had a working python script.
For the rest of the lesson I worked on this blog, sorting out the repeat on the background and attempting to display images. I did not manage to display any images, but next lesson I will look it up and try to fix my dilemma.</td>
